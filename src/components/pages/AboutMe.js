        Hi! My name is Joshua Rowan and I am a web development student currently enrolled in UTSA's edX fullstack
        bootcamp program. I am very grateful to be pursuing my passion for technology and transitioning into a
        career as a web developer. The projects I have feature here represent my current learning. Each one contains
        a link to its repo, if you wish to investigate the code further.
      </p>

        Before pursuing web development, I worked as an elementary and middle school teacher, where I honed myskills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.

        I enjoy theatre and spending time with my family. Thank you for taking the time to learn
        a little bit about me. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing my future projects with the world!
